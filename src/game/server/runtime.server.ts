// Server Runtime Entry Point
// NOTE: This file is for STANDALONE mode only (single-place game)
// For multiplace games, this file should NOT be included in the Rojo project
// Each place has its own runtime that calls initializeGameServer()

// Uncomment below for standalone mode:
// import { initializeGameServer } from "./bootstrap";
// initializeGameServer();
// print("[Server] Started (standalone mode)");

// This file intentionally does nothing in multiplace mode
// to prevent double-initialization of services
