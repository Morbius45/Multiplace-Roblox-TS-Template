// Client Runtime Entry Point
// NOTE: This file is for STANDALONE mode only (single-place game)
// For multiplace games, this file should NOT be included in the Rojo project
// Each place has its own runtime that calls initializeGameClient()

// Uncomment below for standalone mode:
// import { initializeGameClient } from "./bootstrap";
// initializeGameClient();
// print("[Client] Started (standalone mode)");

// This file intentionally does nothing in multiplace mode
// to prevent double-initialization of controllers
